This project is a PWM IP block on the FPGA with a firmware control system on the ARM microprocessor.
The PWM IP is used to control the brighness on the LEDs, and the switches on the Blackboard select the
frequency.

1. Design and implement a PWM IP block
2. Create a programmable 4-channel PWM LED controller
3. Create a four-channel PWM controller with programmable PWM frequencies
