A VHDL project that uses a mixture of reasources on the FPGA and ARM microprocessor
to create a reaction time measurement game. A start button is pushed, and a random
amount of time later, the seven segment display lights up and starts counting. Once
the user pushes a react button, the amount of time it took them to hit the button
is recorded. Once 3 or more measurements are completed, the average of the measurements 
can be displayed using an average button.

1. Create a four-digit stopwatch on your Blackboard
2. Create a Reaction Time Monitor 
3. Calculate the average across multiple measurements
