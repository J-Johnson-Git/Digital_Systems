This project is a simple IP block on the FPGA that controls the LEDs, and a firmware control system on 
the ARM microprocessor on Real Digital's Blackboard.

1. Verify the Demo Project
2. Test Various Blinking Patterns by modifying the Software
3. Create functions to control LEDs
4. Add an enable LED Functionality to your myled IP
